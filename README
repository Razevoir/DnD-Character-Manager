Introduction:

DnD Character Manager is a project that aims to automate the tedium of writing down, erasing, recalculating, and rule checking all of the changes you'll invitably make to a character over the course of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
It currently targets DnD 3.5, but I plan to add support for other systems as time goes on.

The main reason this project is put together in C++ and not something that would have made the project much easier is that I wanted to experiment with developing software using various toolkits available on the market.
I originallly started this project in Python using PyQt.
I changed away from that because PyQt didn't link against the system version of Qt, resulting in a very non-native looking application.

Build instructions:

You'll need CMake to compile the project, whatever platform you're targeting.
Then, you need to make sure that you have the right dependencies installed for whatever GUI API you want to build for.
Navigate to the top directory of the project, type 'cmake .', then type 'make'.
If you're targeting Windows with Visual Studio, you can just open the top level directory and VS will update the project for you.
The Qt build currently supports all features of the core library, but the Win32 build is very bare bones.
